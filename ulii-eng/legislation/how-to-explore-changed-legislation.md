Did you know that you can compare previous versions of a piece of legislation, which aids comparative legal research?&#x20;

## Explore what's changed:

1. Open an act or other piece of legislation
2. Legislation that has changed will have a **What changed?** annotation on the right-hand side margin of the page.

### How to compare versions:

Comparing the current and previous versions of a provision;

1. Click the **What changed?** button
2. A pop-up box will appear allowing you to choose which versions you would like to compare&#x20;
3. The text highlighted in green is what has been added and the text in red has been removed.
4. Check the box to view the changes **side-by-side**

### Tips:

* When viewing the provision side-by-side; the left-hand side is the **previous version** and the **amended version** is displayed on the right-hand side.
* "**This is the latest version of this Act**" notice at the top of the document means that all amendments have been applied to the document and you are viewing the latest version of the legislation.
* "**There are outstanding amendments that have not yet been applied. See the History tab for more information.**" notice at the top of the document means that there are amendments to the legislation that have been made but are not yet reflected in the current version you are viewing.
