# Commenting in a document




1. Open the document you want to work on.
2. Ensure you are logged into your account to enable the commenting feature.
3. Navigate through the document and locate the section you want to comment on.
4. Click and drag your cursor over the specific text to highlight it, a pop-up menu appears next to the highlighted text.

7. Click "Save" to confirm your comment and ensure the document is saved if it has not already been saved.

10. Click the comment icons to view, edit, or delete annotations on your saved documents.

### Tip:

Deleting all comments from a saved document does not remove the document from your saved list. If you want to see the number of comments on a document, check the comment iconsâ€”they display the count.
