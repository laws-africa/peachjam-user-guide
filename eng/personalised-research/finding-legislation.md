# Getting started

Use saved documents, comments and other features to personalise your research experience and find what you're looking for more easily.

* [Save a document](saving-a-document.md) into your private collection to find it easily later.
* [Make private comments](add-and-manage-comments-in-a-document.md) on a document to remember key sections.
* [Follow courts and other topics of interest](../follow-topics-of-interest.md) to be notified when new documents are added.
* [Create search alerts](../finding-information/creating-search-alerts.md) and get notified when new results match your queries
